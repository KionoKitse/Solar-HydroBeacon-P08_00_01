In an unusual twist of fate, while browsing Hackaday I came across something that might be really g=helpful for this project. I don't quite remember how I found <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/164682-a-cheap-and-dangerous-garden-light-boost-converter/details">this</a> particular project but found it I did. The gist of the project is using a solar LED driver to generate a stable DC voltage that is high enough to run an ATtiny85. The solar LED driver will take in 1.2V from a Ni-CD battery and create a high frequency output with voltage spikes as high as 10V. The solar LED driver isn't something new and I've even tried running an ATtiny85 directly off the output pin but not had any luck. I think the current was too low or the oscillation frequency was not fast enough to keep the microcontroller running happily. What makes this project interesting though is that Randy uses a capacitor to store of the charge and smooth out the voltage spikes. These high voltage spikes slowly raise the capacitor voltage and eventually the voltage in the capacitor will reach 10V if the output current is less than the input current. To work around this, Randy makes use of the ATtiny85's ability to read the VCC voltage through reading the ADC. When it detects the voltage getting higher than some set voltage it sends a signal to the LED driver to turn off. This works because most solar LED drivers have a CE pin that is used to detect when it's dark outside and it's time to turn on the lights. Conversely when the input voltage gets low the microcontroller can also signal to the solar LED driver to turn back on. 
The other interesting thing about Randy's project is that it contains links to other similar projects.

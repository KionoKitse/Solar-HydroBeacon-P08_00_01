I finally got the eagerly awaited components from Mouser and was able to test some of the solar DC-DC converter designs that I was interested in. The most simple design is was the <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/164682-a-cheap-and-dangerous-garden-light-boost-converter/details">Randy Elwin design</a>. I quickly tried it a while back but was not able to get it to work. I didn't have much time to work with it but looking back I had my wiring wrong and the ANA608s I have work differently than the YX8051s that Randy was using. The design that I was most interested in trying was the <a href="https://dzrmo.wordpress.com/2017/01/02/garden-light-redux-aka-joule-thief-p-1/">DZRMO design</a>. It's pretty much the same thing but with a zener regulating the output voltage instead of using the ATtiny85's output pin to control the LED driver. I was also interested in the <a href="https://skootsone.yolasite.com/solar-led-msp430.php">SKootS design</a> but have not had a chance to try it yet. I was able to get the DZRMO design to work with the new components.

After my success with getting a stable voltage output I looked at some different parameters to see if it's possible to optimize the circuit a little. What I've found in testing is that the zener diode doesn't seem to be necessary always. When the ATtiny85 is doing nothing the constant voltage input hovers around 3.4V. If the microcontroller is in sleep mode this value can escalate quite quickly and easily ramp up over the max voltage. The zener will prevent this from happening by allowing the excess voltage to drain to ground. If I don't put the microcontroller to sleep, the zener won't be necessary. I haven't done any tests yet to see if the microcontroller idling uses more current than the microcontroller sleeping with the zener draining the excess current. For now though I'll skip on the zener since that would simplify the code to just not put the microcontroller in sleep mode. The other part I optimized is the capacitor size. Originally I was testing with a 1400uF capacitor but it seems to work with capacitors as low as 47uF. I tried a 10uF capacitor and fried the microcontroller while I wasn't paying attention. I also checked to see if a rectifier diode would work in place of the Schottky diode. In this case it doesn't seem to work. With the Schottky diode I'm getting about 3.4V but with the rectifier diode I'm getting about 2V. There is some wiggle room in selecting the inductor and that does seem to effect the output voltage as well but I don't have my notes on that right now.

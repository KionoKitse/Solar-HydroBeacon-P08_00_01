Over the weekend I was able to make some good progress and I can see this project actually coming together now. After my success with the solar power circuit I started working on an initial prototype. What I'm thinking is that the Solar HydroBeacon will charge the batteries all day. When it gets dark outside, the circuit will power on the microcontroller, sample the soil moisture and blink away night with the results. This should work pretty well because the solar LED driver will easily handle the charging and switchover to powering the microcontroller. On the microprocessor side I will need a red LED, green LED, soil moisture sensor, and a way to adjust the soil moisture threshold. The soil moisture sensor will be one of the DIY resistive sensors I've made in the past. To set the soil moisture threshold I will use a trimpot. This should work well since I can tune the trimpot to match the level of resistance that the soil moisture sensor would typically output if the soil is dry. The microcontroller will only need to compare the two values to determine which LED to turn on. Given that I will have a variable input voltage, this makes a lot of sense because the <b>analogRead</b> function is voltage dependent.  
I was able to breadboard a prototype based on the drawing below and created an AVR sketch for the microcontroller to test with. For setting the soil moisture level, I got some soil that was at the level of dryness that would typically require watering then adjusted the trimpot just until it switched from blinking green to blinking red. Next I watered the soil and checked that it was still blinking green. After the soil dried out a few days latter I came back and verified that the microcontroller was blinking red. 

Anyway lets get back to the prototype.
